Max MSP Computer simulation
===

This is like my pure data project except I'm translating the patches into max msp patches and further more, making the chips 16 bit! I plan on taking the project to it's logical conclusion and hopefully have a fully simulated HACK cpu and maybe more!

For the RAM16k, I had to come up with a different solution because defining it recursively with previous RAM chips would not have been feasible. Thankfully, the solution should work just as well!
