Max MSP Computer simulation
===

This is like my pure data project except I'm translating the patches into max msp patches and further more, making the chips 16 bit! I plan on taking the project to it's logical conclusion and hopefully have a fully simulated HACK cpu and maybe more!

For the RAM16k, I had to come up with a different solution because defining it recursively with previous RAM chips would not have been feasible. Thankfully, the solution should work just as well!

I've also organized the files in separate directories. In order for Max/MSP to access them, you'll have to add the directory path in the max file preferences.
